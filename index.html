            <p>Hi all! I grew up in the north Chicago suburbs and graduated from University of Illinois at Urbana
            Champaign.
            I enjoy reading books, hanging out with friends, working out, watching t.v. and traveling. My ultimate
            dream
            is to work remotely as a programmer and travel the world while doing so. Eventually I would like to
            settle down and run a
            hobby farm with many animals and visitors.<br><br>
    
            I'd like to use my programming abilities to better the world whether it be through business or a non
            profit.
            I plan to master all the coding languages to create cool products, meet new people, and have fun!</p>
